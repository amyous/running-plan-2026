              <div className="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <p><strong>A-Races vs B-Races:</strong> Sydney HM and Gold Coast Marathon are your A-races - give these full effort! UTA50 and UTMB OCC are B-races - goal is to finish and enjoy, not race hard. This approach protects your body and ensures quality performances where it matters most.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Aggressive Marathon Long Run Build:</strong> Your marathon long runs progress boldly: 30km (Week 17) → 33km (Week 18) → 37km peak (Week 19). The 37km happens on 14 June - exactly 3 weeks before Gold Coast Marathon. This aggressive progression works because your UTA50 endurance base (51.6km just 4 weeks prior) gives you the aerobic foundation. Then a proper 2-week taper.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The 37km Long Run Strategy:</strong> Week 19's 37km run (14 June) is 3 weeks before Gold Coast Marathon on 5 July. Run the entire distance at 7min/km with your cousin. Don't add marathon pace sections - the distance itself is the stimulus. Fuel every 30-45 minutes, practice your race nutrition strategy. This massive run builds enormous confidence for your 4:15 goal.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your Social Runs Are Perfect:</strong> Saturday social runs (7-8min/km) and Sunday long runs with cousin (7min/km) are IDEAL easy pace running. Don't feel pressure to run faster - this builds aerobic base and allows recovery. Your Wednesday speed sessions provide the intensity needed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Training with Your Cousin:</strong> Having a consistent long run partner through Gold Coast Marathon is brilliant! You'll build the same endurance base together through Week 22. For weeks with faster sections (like week 9), start together and break off for the fast portion, then cool down together. After the marathon, you'll continue Saturday social runs with friends but do Sunday runs solo for UTMB OCC prep.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The UTA50 Challenge:</strong> Running 51.6km only 13 days after Sydney HM requires conservative approach. Walk ALL steep sections - power hiking saves massive energy. Fuel every 30-45min. Goal is finishing under 8 hours feeling good, not racing hard. You have Gold Coast Marathon 7 weeks later.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Post-Marathon to UTMB Timeline:</strong> 8 weeks between Gold Coast (5 Jul) and UTMB OCC (27 Aug) is tight but manageable. Weeks 23-24 are full recovery. Weeks 25-26 rebuild trail fitness. Week 27 is your RACE SIMULATION - back-to-back long runs (20km Saturday evening + 30km Sunday morning) to test fueling and mental toughness on fatigued legs. Week 28-29 final prep and taper. This works because UTMB is a B-race - you're finishing for the experience, not racing for time.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Include 2x weekly on Monday and Wednesday: glute bridges, single-leg deadlifts, calf raises, planks, side planks. 20-30 minutes each session. This protects against accumulated fatigue and injury. During recovery weeks, go lighter with higher reps.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Fueling Strategy:</strong> Practice during long runs. For UTA50: fuel every 30-45min (gels, bars, real food at aid stations). For Gold Coast Marathon: fuel every 5km starting at 10km. For UTMB OCC: fuel every 30-45min, take everything at aid stations, poles recommended.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Recovery is Non-Negotiable:</strong> Week 16 (post-UTA50) and weeks 23-24 (post-marathon) are crucial. Take rest days seriously. Sleep 8-9+ hours nightly. No strength training during full recovery weeks. Quality recovery determines your next race success.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Travel Considerations:</strong> UTMB week includes Mon/Tue travel to Chamonix, race Thursday. Build this into your taper - no hard running on arrival days. Use Monday/Tuesday for light walks and settling in. Race is Thursday so you have Friday-Sunday to celebrate!</p>
